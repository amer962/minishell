/* execute redirection */
/*


let say that we have twe type of:
1: command < file command_continues
2: < file command command_continues

lets say that
we have the first
command < file command_continues

excute_varaible: temp
temp: command command_continues
temp2: file(redirection[0])

issue here: 
command < file command_continues < file < file .....
in the first we have to save command in one varaible
in the second we have to change to files


implement:
1: save the first command
